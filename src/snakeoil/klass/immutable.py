    Make instance immutable, but allow __init__ to mutate.

    Like :class:Strict, these protections can be sidestepped by
    object.__setatttr__ directly. Additionally for any code decoratored with
    :meth:allow_mutation, mutation is allowed in that invocation.

    Once in a mutation block, anything that block calls is still allowed to
    mutate this instance unless it enters another mutation block (another instance),
    and that block tries to mutate the original instance.  TL;dr: you'll know
    if you hit that edgecase.

    >>> from snakeoil.klass.immutable import Simple
    >>> class foo(Simple):
    ...   def __init__(self):
    ...     self.x = 1 # works
    ...     self._subinit() # works, we're in a mutation context
    ...   def _subinit(self):
    ...     # this only works if invoke in a mutation context.
    ...     # IE, __init__ for example.
    ...     self.x = 2
    >>>
    >>> try: foo().x =1 # doesn't
    ... except AttributeError: pass
    >>>
    >>> try: foo()._subinit() # same thing, this is disallowed
    ... except AttributError: pass

    This is async and thread safe.  It is not safe within generator context
    due to a python limitation.
